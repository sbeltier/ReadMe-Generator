### Description
This project enables the user to quickly create a properly formatted ReadMe with all necessary information.

### Installation
This ReadMe Generator runs on Node.js and uses the npm package Inquirer. To prepare your Node.js environment, open your command-line and type the following:
1.) type: npm install
2.) type: npm i inquirer


### Usage
After successfully going through Installation, the user must type 'node index.js' in the command-line. The command-line will then ask the user a series of questions to gather information to create the README file. After completing the prompts, a file named README.md will be created.
